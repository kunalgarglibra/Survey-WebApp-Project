Developed a dynamic Web Application utilizing Angular and .NET Framework, enabling users to create and manage surveys with ease:
  1. Implemented secure login and logout functionality for both users and administrators, with administrators having the added ability to create, delete, and edit surveys and user accounts.
  2. Designed a user-friendly survey creation process, allowing for surveys to be named and described questions to be added, and the survey to be saved. If necessary, editing options can be made available to modify a survey. Once a survey is published, it becomes read-only.
  3. Integrated a reporting feature, providing administrators with valuable statistics about the survey's performance.
